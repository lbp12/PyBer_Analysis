# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
In this analysis I looked at the ride-sharing data by city type. Then narrowing down the data I specifically looked at weekly fares for each city type to see how the data differs in each type. This will help PyBer in making decisions of where to focus efforts.

## Results
Each city type had many differences. The Urban city type had significantly more rides along with more drivers. This city type also had a staggeringly higher total fares collected. However, the Urban city type had the lowest average fare per ride, as well as per driver. This could be because of the competition of drivers in this area causing lower fares and less money going to each driver.

On the other hand Rural areas had the least amount of riders and drivers, but had the highest average fare per ride and per driver. Although it still had the lowest total fares.

This was the similar case when looking at the weekly total fare by city type. Urban has the most fares collected over this period of time, while Rural is the lowest.

## Summary
A few recomendations for the CEO:
  - Due to population being lower in the Rural areas it may be better to focus marketing efforts in the       Suburban ares because they have higher average fares per ride and per driver than Urban, but could       see an increase in total rides. 
  - We could continue to expand in the Urban areas as well, since it is continuing to increase in      popularity for riders and drivers, bringing in the highest revenue.
  - Increasing the total rides in the Urban areas compared to the total drivers may also continue to increase profits, because currently there are about 800 more drivers in this area compared to the total rides.
